# CS110 Final Exam

## SHORT DESCRIPTION *(1 or 2 sentences describing your program)*
  This program will use the NASA API to show the user the latitude and longitude of a spot and the user will guess which city in the world that spot is. Their answer will be compared against the GeoDataSource API, which will know what city (or nearest city) has that latitude and longitude.
## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS *(list any known bugs or non-working parts)*
  For some reason, the APIs that I chose only work with my code sometimes, but this was something that came up far to late in my process and I did not have enough time to debug fully or find new APIs/come up with a new project idea.
## REFERENCES *(any resources you use outside of class materials)*
  Daily Python
  StackOverflow
## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS *(anything else you would like the grader to know)*
